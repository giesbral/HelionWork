This repository contains some of my previous UI/UX work for Helion Software Inc. in Salem, Oregon. It contains screenshots of several web and desktop applications, and includes documentation (authored by me for Helion Software) for a subset of those applications.

Included applications:

  ORCATS Management is a web application that allows county assessors to look up and update rules for property tax assessment.

  Helion Management is a web application that controls department-wide Helion application settings and permissions.
  
  Property Appraisal is a desktop application that allows county assessors to appraise property and manage tax accounts.

Both of the web applications were built using Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC framework, C#, Razor, and HTML/CSS. The desktop application was built using Microsoft WPF, C#, and XAML. All the applications use a SQL Server database.

I've included the user guides for Helion Management and Property Appraisal that I wrote as a part of their respective projects. These documents include detailed screenshots and descriptions of behavior.
